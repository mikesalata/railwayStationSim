### About
PKP station (railway station) lobby simulation with visualisation in Java 21 + Java FX.
A client enter the station,
buys a train ticket (in city/intercity ticket office),
then optionally go for information (info office),
then finally moves away from lobby.
Additionally:
* clients waits in queues to get to offices
* ticket offices may take a break sometime
* info office may experience a workstation malfunction - in that case it needs to be repaired by technician to continue its work.
